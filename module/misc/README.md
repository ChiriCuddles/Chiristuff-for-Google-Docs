## Misc
- Collapses document headers in the outline by default, allowing you to toggle whether sub-headers are shown by right clicking on them. All headers can be collapsed & expanded by right clicking on the outline header.
- Filters document headers shown in the link creation menu to the ones matching the text in the URL input.
- Removes the line separating pages in compact mode
- Adds a large margin after the last page (50% of the screen minus 100pt)
- Removes pointless garbage like "explore" and "app switching" buttons
- Makes sidebars appear above the document like they should have in the first place
- Fix pulse animation overflowing on highlighted text when in compact mode (for example, using find & navigating to a result at the edge of a page will cut off some of the highlight)
- Adds new keyboard shortcuts:
	- `Ctrl + Shift + -`
		- Inserts a horizontal line
	- `Ctrl + F`
		- Like normal, focuses the search input. 
		- When text is selected, does a search for that text. 
		- When text is not selected, clears the search input.
	- `Ctrl + K`
		- Like normal, opens the link creation tooltip.
		- When text is not selected, acts as normal.
		- When text is selected, and the URL input is currently blank, inserts that text into the URL input.
	- `Escape` (when Dictionary sidebar is open & focus is within)
		- Closes sidebar
