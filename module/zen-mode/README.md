# Zen Mode
- Adds a new display mode toggled by right clicking the Google Docs logo, or `Alt + F11`, "Zen Mode"
- Zen Mode hides almost all elements by default, leaving only your document
- The toolbar and menu bars are hidden, but will slide into place when your mouse is near the top
- Comments are hidden by default, but will appear when focused
- The live word count will appear at the bottom, subtle and out of the way
